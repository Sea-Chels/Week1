# <Horiseon-Webpage-Practice>
## Description
This was a **project to practice** commenting on css files properly, as well as looking at an html file and not only consolidating tags and ensuring that they are as descriptive as possible but also ensuring that the file is accessible as possible to anyone who may need a screen reader while using this website. 
In this practice I learned how to comment on a css file in a way that helps other understand the thought bprocess behind the page and the layout, as well as the code behind it, and how the css ties to the code. I made the file more accessible by adding alt tags and descriptions to each of the photos or icons used in the webpage. I also cleaned up some of the html syntax by adding more descriptive tags like main, section, nav and got rid of most of the undescriptive tags like div. 

we were given a screenshot of what the website should look like and whilst I was changing the html and css it was critical to the project that the website stayed up to 90% of what it originally looked like.
